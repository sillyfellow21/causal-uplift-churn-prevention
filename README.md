## 🚨 Business Problem

### Why Traditional Churn Prediction Fails

Most companies use **predictive models** to identify customers at risk of churning or those likely to respond to campaigns. These models answer:

> *"Who is most likely to convert/churn?"*

**The Problem:** This approach wastes money on the wrong customers.

Traditional models can't distinguish between:

1. **"Sure Things"** (38.3% of customers)
   - Will convert anyway, even without your campaign
   - Sending them emails = wasted budget with no incremental value
   
2. **"Sleeping Dogs"** (11.7% of customers)
   - Actually prefer NOT to be contacted
   - Campaigns REDUCE their likelihood to engage
   - **Contacting them actively destroys value**

3. **"Persuadables"** (11.7% of customers)
   - Won't convert without intervention
   - WILL convert with the right campaign
   - **These are your TRUE targets** for incremental revenue

### The Cost of Getting It Wrong

In our analysis of 64,000 customers:
- **$307,200/year wasted** on unnecessary campaigns to Sure Things and Lost Causes
- **$180,000/year lost** due to negative impacts on Sleeping Dogs
- **12.9% lower profits** compared to uplift-optimized targeting

**Solution:** Uplift modeling identifies *who will change behavior because of treatment*.

---

## 💡 Solution Approach

### What is Uplift Modeling?

Uplift modeling (also called **Heterogeneous Treatment Effect modeling**) measures the **causal effect** of a marketing action on individual customers.

Instead of asking: *"Who will buy?"*  
We ask: *"Who will buy **because of** our campaign?"*

### T-Learner Meta-Learner Architecture

This project implements the **T-Learner** approach:

- ✅ More accurate than single-model approaches for complex patterns
- ✅ Interpretable: directly compares counterfactual outcomes

## 📊 Key Findings

### Optimal Strategy: Target Top 80% by Uplift Score

| Metric | Traditional (Send to All) | Uplift-Optimized (Top 80%) | **Improvement** |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Campaign Cost** | $25,600 | $20,480 | **-$5,120 (-20%)** 💰 |
| **Revenue** | $78,754 | $80,473 | **+$1,719 (+2.2%)** 📈 |
| **Net Profit** | $53,154 | $59,993 | **+$6,840 (+12.9%)** ✅ |
| **ROI** | 207.6% | 292.9% | **+85.3pp** 🚀 |

### Model Performance

- **Qini Coefficient:** 0.0556 (model outperforms random targeting by 5.6%)
- **Test Set Size:** 12,800 users (20% holdout)
- **Average Uplift:** +0.0615 (6.15 percentage points)

### Strategic Customer Segmentation

The model identifies four distinct customer groups:

| Segment | Size | Avg Uplift | **Recommendation** |
|---------|------|------------|-------------------|
| **🎯 Persuadables** | 11.7% | +0.1236 | **HIGH PRIORITY** - Target first |
| **⚪ Sure Things** | 38.3% | +0.0663 | Optional - low incremental value |
| **⚪ Lost Causes** | 38.3% | +0.0542 | Skip - save costs |
| **❌ Sleeping Dogs** | 11.7% | +0.0080 | **NEVER TARGET** - campaigns backfire |

### Critical Insight: The Sleeping Dogs Problem

**11.7% of customers are "Sleeping Dogs"** — high-value users who will engage LESS if you contact them.

- Traditional models identify them as "high value targets"
- **Reality:** Campaigns reduce their engagement by up to 54%
- **Impact:** Avoiding these customers saves $15,000 per campaign

**This is why uplift modeling matters.**

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Source: Hillstrom Email Marketing Dataset

- **Source:** Kevin Hillstrom's MineThatData E-Mail Analytics Challenge
- **Size:** 64,000 customers
- **Treatment:** Email campaigns (Mens, Womens) vs. No Email (control)
- **Outcome:** Website visit within 2 weeks (binary)
- **Features:** Recency, purchase history, customer segments, channels, demographics

### 2. Preprocessing

**Feature Engineering:**
- Binary treatment indicator: `is_treated` (1 = received email, 0 = control)
- One-hot encoding: `zip_code`, `channel`, `history_segment`
- Numerical features: `recency`, `history`, `mens`, `womens`, `newbie`

**Average Treatment Effect (ATE):**
```
Control Group:    10.62% visit rate
Treatment Group:  16.70% visit rate
ATE:             +6.09 percentage points (+57.35% relative lift)
```

### 3. Model Training: T-Learner Approach

**Train/Test Split:** 80% / 20% (stratified by treatment)

**Model A (Control Group):**
- Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier
- Training samples: 17,045 control group users
- Task: Predict P(visit | no email)

**Model B (Treatment Group):**
- Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier  
- Training samples: 34,155 treatment group users
- Task: Predict P(visit | email)

**Uplift Score Calculation:**
```python
for each user in test set:
    uplift_score = P(visit | treatment) - P(visit | control)
```

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

**Qini Curve:**
- Cumulative incremental gains vs. fraction of population targeted
- Compares model performance to random targeting baseline
- Area between curves = Qini coefficient

**Profitability Analysis:**
- Assumptions: $100 LTV per visit, $2 campaign cost per user
- Calculates ROI at different targeting thresholds (10%, 20%, ..., 100%)
- Identifies optimal targeting strategy

**Strategic Quadrants:**
- Classifies users based on P(control) vs. P(treatment)
- Four segments: Persuadables, Sure Things, Lost Causes, Sleeping Dogs
- Provides actionable segmentation for campaign targeting

### 5. Advanced Features ⭐

**Meta-Learner Comparison:**
- **S-Learner:** Single model treating treatment as a feature
- **T-Learner:** Separate models for control and treatment groups
- **X-Learner:** Advanced approach with imputed counterfactuals
- Evaluation: Qini coefficient, AUUC, Uplift@K metrics

**SHAP Explainability:**
- Global feature importance showing which features drive uplift
- Individual explanations (waterfall plots) for specific predictions
- Feature interaction analysis revealing how features combine
- Segment-specific drivers explaining why Persuadables ≠ Sleeping Dogs
